### Sysmtem Instructions

- The technical details of this project are present in `TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md` file
- The implementation strategy is simple:
  - Work on one phase at a time.
  - In each phase, implement one feature at a time.
  - For each feature, first implement it, then test it against it's success criteria and then finally give me a summary of changes which I will add to the commit message.
- Move to the next phase/feature only after the current phase/feature is completely implemented and tested.
